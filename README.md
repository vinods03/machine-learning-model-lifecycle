Regression - Life Expectancy.ipynb depicts all the steps involved in the development, deployment and maintenance of a machine learning model:

    1. data analysis / visualization
    2. data pre-processing (encoding of categorical variables, handling of nulls etc)
    3. model development
    4. hyper-parameter tuning
    5. model deployment (various types of model deployment are shown here)
    6. model explainability
    7. data quality monitoring
    8. model quality monitoring

Life Expectancy Data.csv is the raw input for which the model is being built. 

preprocessornew.py is the pre-processing script used to modify the inference data as required by the data quality monitor.

Regression - Life Expectancy.ipynb depicts all the steps involved in the development, deployment and maintenance of a machine learning model:
1. data analysis / visualization
2. data pre-processing (encoding of categorical variables, handling of nulls etc)
3. model development
4. hyper-parameter tuning
5. model deployment (various types of model deployment are shown here)
6. model explainability
7. data quality monitoring
8. model quality monitoring
